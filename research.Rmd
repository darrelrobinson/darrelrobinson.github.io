## Self-Censorship in Authoritarian States: Response bias in measures of popular support in China

#### With Marcus Tannenberg, University of Gothenburg

Abstract: The study of popular support for authoritarian regimes, and the comparative study of political
attitudes, has long relied on the assumption that survey respondents provide truthful answers on
surveys. However, when measuring regime support in closed political systems there is a distinct risk
that individuals are less than forthright due to fear that their opinions may be made known to the
public or the authorities. In order to test this assumption, we conducted a novel web-based survey
in China in which we included four list experiments of commonly used items in the comparative
literature on regime support. We find systematic bias for all four measures as a result of self-censorship;
substantially more individuals state that they support the regime with direct questioning
than do when presented with our anonymous, indirect list experiments. The level of self-censorship,
which ranges from 16 to 22 percentage points, is considerably higher than previously thought. Self-censorship
is further most prevalent among the wealthy, urban, female and younger respondents.
These findings indicate that prior studies that have found high levels of support for the Chinese
regime using these particular measures likely overestimate the true level of support. Further, cross-national
studies which compare popular support across regime type may be systematically biased if
responses are not subject to the same level of falsification across regime types.

## Learning Politics: Revisiting the compensation hypothesis between education and political knowledge

Abstract: In spite of a robust correlation between education and political knowledge recent results from matching and quasi-experimental studies have been inconsistent.  I argue that family background of students can help to explain these diverging findings.  I test the compensation hypothesis that education should affect students that come from homes with low levels of political discussion to a greater degree with a twin-matching design.  Previous studies of the compensation hypothesis are limited in two respects â€“ they are open to social desirability bias in the dependent variable, or rely on proxies for political discussion in the home.  This study addresses these two limitations.  I find that education has a positive effect on political knowledge independent of family background and genetics, but only among those that are less exposed to political discussion in the home.  Among those who frequently discussed politics with family during their upbringing, education does not lead to greater political knowledge.  

Currently under review.
