Hi and welcome to my webpage.  My name is Darrel Robinson and I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Government at Uppsala University, and I am also affiliated with the Uppsala Center for Labor Studies.  I conduct my research on the formation of political attitudes and currently I focus primarily on citizens' attitudes towards CCP rule in China.
