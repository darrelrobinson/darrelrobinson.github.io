This section of my webpage is just a various collection of things I've done in R that I thought were interesting.  

The first example, this webpage!  It's written entirely in RMarkdown and hosted on github. <a href="http://nickstrayer.me/RMarkdown_Sites_tutorial/" target="_blank">This</a> blog post got me started so check it out if you're interested in creating a page yourself with RMarkdown.  Also, you can find my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/darrelrobinson" target="_blank">here</a> if you want to see what I've done.
