title: "R Projects"

This section of my webpage is just a various collection of things I've done in R that I thought were interesting.  

The first example, this webpage!  It's written entirely in RMarkdown and hosted on github.  [This](http://nickstrayer.me/RMarkdown_Sites_tutorial/) blog post got me started so check it out if you're interested in creating a page yourself with RMarkdown.  You can find my GitHub [here](https://github.com/darrelrobinson) if you want to see what I've done.
