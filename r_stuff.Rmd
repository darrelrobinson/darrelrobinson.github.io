This section of my webpage is just a various collection of things I've done in R that I thought were interesting.  


## [Personal webpage](https://github.com/darrelrobinson)

The first project, this webpage!  It's written entirely in RMarkdown and hosted on GitHub. <a href="http://nickstrayer.me/RMarkdown_Sites_tutorial/" target="_blank">This</a> blog post and <a href="http://www.lucymcgowan.com/index.html" target="_blank">Lucy D'Agostino McGowan's</a> GitHub got me started so check them out if you're interested in creating a page yourself with RMarkdown.

## [A visualization of why dummy variables shift the intercept in linear regression](dummy.html)

In the BA Research methods course at the Department of Government we introduce to students dummy variables in linear regression.  In class we demonstrate mathematically that dummy variables shift the intercept of the regression line by studying the regression line equation, but a visualization of why this is the case can be helpful so that students can see how this happens. In this project I use interactive 3D visualizations to demonstrate this concept.


## An RShiny app to explore some of the World Values Survey

When I read about <a href=https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RShiny</a> I felt I had to test it out.  What is RShiny?  It's a package that lets you build web apps in R to explore your data or build dashboards.
