<h2>Self-Censorship in Authoritarian States: Response bias in measures of popular support in China</h2>
<div id="with-marcus-tannenberg-university-of-gothenburg" class="section level4">
<h4>With Marcus Tannenberg, University of Gothenburg</h4>
<p>Abstract: The study of popular support for authoritarian regimes, and the comparative study of political attitudes, has long relied on the assumption that survey respondents provide truthful answers on surveys. However, when measuring regime support in closed political systems there is a distinct risk that individuals are less than forthright due to fear that their opinions may be made known to the public or the authorities. In order to test this assumption, we conducted a novel web-based survey in China in which we included four list experiments of commonly used items in the comparative literature on regime support. We find systematic bias for all four measures as a result of self-censorship; substantially more individuals state that they support the regime with direct questioning than do when presented with our anonymous, indirect list experiments. The level of self-censorship, which ranges from 16 to 22 percentage points, is considerably higher than previously thought. Self-censorship is further most prevalent among the wealthy, urban, female and younger respondents. These findings indicate that prior studies that have found high levels of support for the Chinese regime using these particular measures likely overestimate the true level of support. Further, cross-national studies which compare popular support across regime type may be systematically biased if responses are not subject to the same level of falsification across regime types.</p>

<h2>Learning Politics: Revisiting the compensation hypothesis between education and political knowledge</h2>
<p>Abstract: In spite of a robust correlation between education and political knowledge recent results from matching and quasi-experimental studies have been inconsistent. I argue that family background of students can help to explain these diverging findings. I test the compensation hypothesis that education should affect students that come from homes with low levels of political discussion to a greater degree with a twin-matching design. Previous studies of the compensation hypothesis are limited in two respects â€“ they are open to social desirability bias in the dependent variable, or rely on proxies for political discussion in the home. This study addresses these two limitations. I find that education has a positive effect on political knowledge independent of family background and genetics, but only among those that are less exposed to political discussion in the home. Among those who frequently discussed politics with family during their upbringing, education does not lead to greater political knowledge.</p>

<h2>Education Opportunity and Support for Authoritarian Rule: Evidence from the expansion of higher education in China</h2>
<p>Abstract: A vast modernization literature argues for the democratizing potential of education. Yet authoritarian regimes throughout the world expand their education systems in an effort to appease citizens and promote economic growth. Scholars of China argue that this strategy allows the regime to enjoy a high level of public support. These two diverging theoretical predictions raise an interesting empirical question, what effect does education opportunity have on individual-level support for authoritarian rule? I leverage an expansion in higher education in China as an identification strategy to study the effect of education opportunity on two measures of support for authoritarian rule: support for government censorship and trust in the central government. While the reform opened millions of positions in higher education, it has also resulted in high graduate unemployment and a general decrease in perceived quality. I find that higher education opportunity led to a substantial decrease in regime support. I further find that education opportunity led to increased belief that citizens should have an input on policy, and increased social trust. I argue that this is evidence that value change in education is responsible for the negative effect of the education reform, not dissatisfaction due to high graduate unemployment.</p>
